# Flexbox Frontier

* About this project:
This was a self-directed learning exercise. My aim was to learn about a particular type of CSS display - 'flexbox'. I heard that it removes the need for certain layout 'hacks' like 'clearfix', while allowing you to achieve aspects of responsive design without 'media queries'. Potentially, it may mean writing less code when designing and developing websites. I had to try it out.
